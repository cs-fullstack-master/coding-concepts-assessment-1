# coding-concepts-assessment-1

> DO NOT REFER TO NOTES OR PAST CODING ASSIGNMENTS

The assessment consists of 2 parts: a coding challenge and then a code walkthough with the staff where we will ask questions about your code.

## Coding Challenge
Using the included *dev portfolio home page wireframe* as a guide.
- Create an HTML page that mimics the design of the home/landing page
  - Note that text and/or images can simply be placeholders and random text
- Using CSS grid, layout the components on the page to mimic your home page design as closely as possible
  - The styling does not need to be elaborate in any way, but should position the different components
- Link a JavaScript file that will mimic the bahavior of a contact form using multiple prompts (it can run automatically when home page is loaded)
  - Prompt for person's name
  - Prompt for person's email
  - Prompt for a contact message 
  - The user should not be able to leave any of the 3 prompts blank and your program should continue to ask for the inputs until a value has been provided for all of them
  - Each of the 3 inputs should be stored into an array
  - After all 3 inputs have been provided, display the entered items in an alert dialog using a template literal to format the entries one per line.
